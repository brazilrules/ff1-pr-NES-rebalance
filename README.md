# ff1-pr-NES-rebalance
A NES Rebalance Mod for FF1 Pixel Remaster

The goal of this mod is to document the formulas used for both the Pixel Remaster and the NES releases, and to make a modification to make the former similar to the latter. In situations where game balance is off, I would consider Final Fantasy Restored as a guide towards what the goal should be.

Current ideas:

- Original EXP/level curve COMPLETED
- Monster stats
- Attack/magic calculations closer to the original
- Make Blind/Sleep worthwhile
- Optionally disable sale of all healing items but Potion, Antidote, Gold Needle. Make potions only heal 30 HP.
